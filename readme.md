# PiE-Mulator

PiE-Mulator is a simulation of the Pioneers in Engineering base kit. It is designed to run inside the online Python IDE, repl.it. This allows any person with a web browser to easily program with API without having to install anything. Running within a web browser, however, limits the simulator to a text representation of the robot.

The robot can be controlled using the API and should behave identically. Features such as asynchronous Python are also implmented.
