# PiE-Mulator

## An emulator of the Pioneers in Engineering base kit robot developed by Wing Lam and Scott Numamoto

PiE-Mulator is designed with the intent to be run in repl.it - an online python development environment. This makes installation to new users virtually instant. PiE-Mulator requires a keyboard and internet connection. Due to these restrictions, we decided to create the graphic representation of the emulator using text art.

PiE-Mulator allows the programmer to write code to control the robot for autonomous mode. Tele-operated mode can be simulated by also programming a set of instructions for a gamepad to follow.
